                            This Surgeries Online project is the output of an academic exercise aimed at developin a prototype system for GPs and surgeries

                             </p>
                    <p class="description"> The projected is developed by IfiokAbasi Essien and supervised by Nicole Yap at the University of Leicester </p>
                    <p class="description">is a project which focuses on health care delivery aiming to ease, enhance and further automate
                        interactions between the major actors especially focusing on the patients.
                        Surgeries and hospitals can register with the system while various user types are associated with a surgery.</p>
                <p class="description">
                  Motivation: Although most surgeries have an online system which patients have access to, only limited functionalities
                    (mainly booking of appointments with doctors) are accessible to patients. The proposed system however aims to support
                    much more functionalities for the patients and reduce the need to physically visit the surgery as much as possible.
                    It would also provide patients with historic records of their data by being able to view their activities over time.
                    </p>
                <p class="description">
                    The system then provides functionalities which support various actions an interactions between users associated with a given surgery e.g.
                    booking/managing of appointments with nurses and doctors, making and management of prescriptions etc.
                    The system also provides support for interactions between different medical facilities which have to do with a patient.
